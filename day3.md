## Learning Journal Day 3

While I am already familiar with all of the topics covered so far, I realized today that my biggest weakness is my lack of practice in being able to execute an idea efficiently and successfully. Today I encountered my first real problem yet during the course. For some reason I had a couple problems implementing questions six and seven, and it took longer than should have been necessary to do so. The problem turned out to be a small mixup with two different variables that caused the whole thing to be thrown off.

However, I eventually solved the problem and am quite happy with where it is now. One thing I really need to work on though, and the most important part of this course for me, is that I simply need to spend a lot of time coding just to become more familiar with the practice and the workflow. I have the knowledge, but it is still somewhat difficult at times to fully think through an idea as thoroughly as I can, and intuitively solve problems as well as I would want to. This only comes with a lot of practice. Having the knowledge is only half of the struggle.
