## Learning Journal Day 13

Today I learned about something new that I have never worked with before. I have not only not worked with local storage before, I had no idea it was a way to store data for a website across browser sessions. It is always fun and satisfying to learn and implement something new.

The hardest part of it is parsing the values of an array or object at the right time to be able to manipulate them in the code. I have worked with JSON before and experienced the woes of parsing it, which is still not something I'm very good at or really enjoy very much. I much prefer reading some dense documentation over attempting to parse JSON. It is something I need to get better at. 

After implementing the local storage, it is satisfying to see my work in action as the chart continues to track the total number of votes for each image. I have to admit that I'm feeling a bit tired right now or I'd try and implement the stretch goal, but I think it will require me to refactor some of my code and I am not in the mood to do that now. Maybe tomorrow.
