## Learning Journal Day 14

For pair programming today we had to build a shopping cart for the bus mall images. We were not able to implement all the required functionality, but made some good progress. I am still getting used to working on the same code with other people. It does not come easy for me; I do not generally mind working together with others, but writing code has always been a solitary activity for me and it is a little difficult to adapt to a team development environment. I think I may have been able to get done a little more on my own just because I am so used to doing this kind of thing on my own and I can work more efficiently.

Of course the benefits of working on a development team outweigh the drawbacks. It is very helpful to delegate responsibilities and work together towards developing a large project, which is made very easy with Git. Talking through what you're doing and hearing how others approach a problem is very beneficial. When encountering a bug or a problem that seems difficult, a team can pool their knowledge and resources together and solve problems more quickly. These are all things I need to keep improving on as I continue to work with others during project week.
