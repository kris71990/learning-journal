## Learning Journal Day 7

Today was a fun day. We learned about constructor functions and generating tables with Javascript. I am somewhat familiar with constructor functions, and it wasn't too hard to work on that. However, I have little experience with tables, and zero experience creating them with javascript. It is a lot cooler than simply writing it into the html. I will need some practice with it, but the general concept is nothing too new or complicated.

Creating and styling the table in the cookie project took maybe a couple hours, and there were no major bumps in the road. However, the problems arose when I tried to implement the stretch goals - generating hourly totals across all locations, and calculating the number of employees necessary to cover the cookie volume. In working on that, I soon discovered that I was generating multiple random hourly totals, so my overall total was a calculation of a completely different set of random numbers. I soon became muddled in the various return values of my prototype functions, which became a bit annoying. As it stands now, I am happy with what I have produced, but I will need to work on it some more to correctly implement those features.
