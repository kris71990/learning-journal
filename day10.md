## Learning Journal Day 10

Today we talked about debugging and css design. While it is often annoying to get errors when writing and testing code, it is a pleasurable skill to have to be able to debug efficiently and successfully. There are many times when I'm testing code where I am pretty sure I will receive an error before I test it, but often I feel like I learn just as much from figuring out how to solve errors as I do from writing successful code. It is a skill that requires a healthy experience of seeing and fixing errors to be good at. It is sometimes a lot of fun to play around with the console to root out errors and think of errors that haven't existed yet. Of course it is ultimately a lot more fun to solve problems right on the first try, but it is also useful to learn from failure.

The CSS lab we did today was the most difficult thing I've done in this course so far. I confess to not being much of a visual design oriented person, and designing web pages with CSS is not my favorite thing to do. I much prefer Javascript. However, it is something I can do, but maybe not quite as well as I could. Sometimes I feel like my CSS code is not as concise and "cascady" as it could be, and I often get the impression that I'm just hacking together a workable solution with excessive padding/margin usage. I don't feel like the way I stitch together my design is at all transferable to the way someone else would view it with a different screen size. It's something I need to improve on.
