## Learning Journal Day 6

Today was a productive day. We covered objects and DOM manipulation in class, which I have some experience with, but it was different learning about them systematically in a classroom setting. Stuff that I taught myself gradually over the course of several weeks was learned in a few hours. It's really nice to take in all the information and immediately put it to use building something of substance. Conceptually I had a good grasp on most of the information already, but it's really helpful to immediately codify the knowledge in the lab. I am really enjoying the process.

I hope that I will continue enhancing and expanding my knowledge, and look forward to learning new stuff and putting in the practice every day.
