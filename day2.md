## Learning Journal Day 2

Today we covered more of the basics of HTML, introduced some CSS, and delved further in to Javascript with an introduction of arrays and the use of some various methods to alter arrays (push, pop, shift, unshift) and deal with numbers (parseInt etc.). I have been familiar with all of the stuff covered so far, but it is always good to get in some more practice so it become easier and easier. 

The practice that has been most useful for me so far is getting used to the terminal a bit more, and making git more second-nature. I have also not used VS code before this class, so it's nice to learn a new editor and become familiar with how it works. 

Overall it has been a pretty smooth/easy start for me, but I look forward to things getting much more intense in the future as I encounter new information and continue to code on a daily basis.
