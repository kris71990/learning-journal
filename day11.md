## Learning Journal Day 11

There wasn't really that much new content today and the lab (so far) has been easier for me than last week's. I was expecting it to be a little more difficult than last week, but I did not have any trouble building the base functionality of the bus mall project. In fact, I am quite happy with the way I was able to use the knowledge and experience gained last week in a more efficient way for the start of today's project. The Javascript and logic flowed a lot more quickly and effectively for me today, and I was able to get the lab off the ground pretty quickly without any real bumps in the road. 

This is one of the things I value most in the bootcamp - the progression of skills introduced and plenty of practice afforded to incorporating new skills with still developing older skills. This allows the older skills to become more intuitive as time goes by and they are used on a consistent basis. As I write more Javascript, I find that it all becomes a bit easier the more I do it. When I was studying on my own and making simple projects I felt that a little bit, but as I do it all day every day, I begin developing a comfort with it that I didn't previously have. I am looking forward to continue tracking my own progress as I get deeper into the course.
