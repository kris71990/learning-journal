## Learning Journal Day 4

Today in class we focused on functions, and the lab was our first pair-programming exercise in refactoring each other's code into functions. The process was straightforward enough for my partner and I, who both seem to have a good grasp on how functions work, and who both had code that was well formatted and functional. 

Still, we encountered an unforeseen hangup when my code broke temporarily after a copy/paste error, which wasn't a big deal and only delayed us for 10-15 minutes. The actual coding was easy, but the most beneficial part of the excercise was working together with someone else and talking through the code together. As someone who has in the past coded only on my own and worked exclusively on my own projects, it is a bit of a shock at first to have to work with someone who is typing on my own code on their own computer, but it is part of the process of growing as a developer. I am well aware that it is a team effort most of the time in the professional world, and that learning to collaborate and bounce ideas off eachother is central to developing professional coding skills. It is also a helpful way to learn new things and build chemistry with the people you're working with. A team that works together well will produce a better product than one that doesn't.
