## Learning Journal Day 5

Today was the first day where I've learned a lot of useful information that I haven't used before. I have used github before and have mastered the ACP procedure, but I have always only used the master branch. Branching, pulling,merging etc are all new skills for me to master - I knew about them generally and how they worked, but it is nice to be able to see and use them in action. It makes me appreciate Git even more, because it really is a great workflow tool. Also the .gitignore file is useful, especially for node_modules, which I have experimented with and pushed to github in the past because I didn't know any better. 

The lab today was pretty straightforward except for a minor bump in the road involving function calling and array manipulation. Always good to get into trouble on something I thought was going to be easy, and learn how much I really need learn and practice. 

The first week was pretty easy for me, just brushing up on stuff and practicing the concepts. I expect it to get a little more difficult from here on out.
